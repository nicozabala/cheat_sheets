# gRPC and Protocol Buffers

## gRPC
gRPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. It is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google that enables communication between distributed systems. gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more.

## Protocol Buffers
Protocol Buffers, also known as Protobuf, is a method developed by Google for serializing structured data. It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a network or for storing data. Protocol Buffers are language-neutral and platform-neutral, making them an excellent choice for data interchange.

### Example of a Protocol Buffers Definition
```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;
  string email = 3;
}
