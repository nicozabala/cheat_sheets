Es el boundingbox

"- It is helpful to display unloaded [[Payload]] as bounding boxes. To support this, Houdini needs to get metadata (the prim type, and the bounding box expressed in the `extentsHint` attribute) from the prim that holds the payload specification, because the data from within the payload is not loaded."
